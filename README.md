## Installation
As the project is currently only the back end, the ideal way to experience it is downloading the source code from https://github.com/Ian-Halll/ThisIsAPostAndPutAndDeleteAndGet, afterwards, the user can install the necessary dependencies using node.js with "npm i" in the root directory terminal, after which the app can be invoked with the command "npm run start" or "node index.js", from there, the server will be live and each of the routes can be tested via insomnia.
      
## Usage
This project is a proof of concept more than anything, displaying the various functions one can perform using MongoDB
